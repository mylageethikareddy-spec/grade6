# ðŸ“˜ Statistics Notes: Mean, Median, and Mode

These are the basic concepts of statistics, useful in mathematics and data analysis.

---

## 1. Mean (Average)
**Definition:**  
The mean is the sum of all numbers divided by the number of values.

**Formula:**  
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of values}}{\text{Number of values}} \]

**Example:**  
Data = [4, 6, 8]  
Sum = 4 + 6 + 8 = 18  
Number of values = 3  
Mean = 18 Ã· 3 = **6**

## 2. Median
**Definition:**  
The median is the middle number when data is arranged in ascending order.  
- If there is an **odd** number of values â†’ the middle one is the median.  
- If there is an **even** number of values â†’ the median is the average of the two middle values.

**Example 1 (odd count):**  
Data = [1, 3, 5]  
Median = 3  

**Example 2 (even count):**  
Data = [2, 4, 6, 8]  
Middle numbers = 4 and 6  
Median = (4 + 6) Ã· 2 = **5**

## 3. Mode
**Definition:**  
The mode is the number that appears **most often** in a dataset.  
- A dataset can have **no mode**, **one mode**, or **multiple modes**.

**Example 1:**  
Data = [2, 4, 4, 5, 7]  
Mode = 4 (appears twice)

**Example 2:**  
Data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
No mode (all appear once)

**Example 3:**  
Data = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4]  
Modes = 2 and 3 (bimodal)

## ðŸ“Š Summary Table

| Concept | Definition | Example Data | Result |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Mean | Sum Ã· Count | [4, 6, 8] | 6 |
| Median (odd) | Middle value | [1, 3, 5] | 3 |
| Median (even) | Average of 2 middle values | [2, 4, 6, 8] | 5 |
| Mode | Most frequent value | [2, 4, 4, 5] | 4 |

âœ… With these three concepts (Mean, Median, Mode), you can describe the **central tendency** of data effectively!
